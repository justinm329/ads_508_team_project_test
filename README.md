# ads_508_team_project_test

### Raw data folder

* This contains the SageMaker notebook that uploaded the data to Athena from S3

### EDA Notebook

* In the EDA notebook, JF_EDA contains most of the EDA used for this project. This notebook was the base for us building our training files

### Models Notebook

* In the model_training folder, the notebooks for creating the training data are stored in the createing_training_data_SM notebook, and the model that we agreed to use in this notebook models_training/ads_508_TrainModel_data (1).ipynb. The other notebook was more for testing our different models and could provide valuable insight, but we separated it to save money on computing with AWS.
