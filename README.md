### Raw data foler

* This contains the sagemaker notebook that uploaded the data to Athena from S3

### EDA Notebook

* In the EDA notebook the notebook JF_EDA contains a majority of the EDA that was used for this project. This notebook was the base for us building our training files

### Models Notebook

* In the model_training folder, you will find a few notebooks with different models. There is also a notebook that creates the training data that is used for our models. The notebook that ends in SM is the one that has the model we would recommend to use if no further research is done.
